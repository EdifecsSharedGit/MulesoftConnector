# Edifecs XEngine Server Anypoint Connector Demo

The demo introduces basic capabilities of the connector that is used to connect to the Edifecs XEServer infrastructure through the REST API. 

The 837P EDI transaction is read from the file system and is sent to backend (the XEServer side) through the Mulesoft Edifecs XEServer Connector. The backend processing results are  saved to the file system.
